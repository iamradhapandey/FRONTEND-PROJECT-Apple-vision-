 Technologies Used

-CSS3: Handled animations, layout design, and media queries to ensure a fluid and responsive experience across devices.
- JavaScript (ES6): Incorporated interactivity and handled animation triggers.
- GSAP ScrollTrigger: Created smooth scroll-based animations and enhanced user interaction.
- Locomotive Scroll: Implemented for smooth scrolling and parallax effects, delivering a visually rich experience.

 How It Works
This website leverages the Locomotive Scroll library to handle the scroll-based parallax and smooth scrolling experience. As the user scrolls, GSAP ScrollTrigger synchronizes the animations and brings key product features to life with smooth transitions. These technologies work together to create an immersive experience, keeping users engaged as they interact with the page.
